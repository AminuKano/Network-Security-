# Packet sniffing 
* Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, and it's a common practice by:

  - Network engineers monitor network traffic and understand valuable network infrastructure and performance insights.
  - Hackers to launch network attacks - Sniffing attacks: eavesdrop on a physical network (wired or wireless).
  
* A packet sniffer itself is passive. It observes messages being sent and received by applications and protocols running on your computer, but never sends packets itself. 

* There are different packet sniffers, including Wireshark, Netwox, Scapy, etc. In this session youâ€™ll get acquainted with Wireshark (packet sniffer), and make some simple packet captures and observations.
