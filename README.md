# Network Security


## Overview of the session 

* This session will cover wired and wireless network traffic analysis and exploration, tricks of pen testing, basic simulation of cyberattacks on a network and computer system, and practicing network security attacks and countermeasures. 
*  During this session, students will practice using some specialised devices, simple cybersecurity breaches and be introduced to certain methods and tricks to protect themselves from eavesdropping devices.
*  Students would be required to have access to a computer system to run a Kali Linux VM either using Oracle VirtualBox/VMware or boot from a USB, and access privilege to download and install applications during the session.
   
## [Introduction - Cyber Security Best Practices and Standards]    


## [Activity 1 - Creating a Rogue Wi-Fi Access Point (30 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Creating%20a%20Rogue%20Wi-Fi%20Access%20Point)
 * Setting up the Lab Environment with Kali Linux
 * Setting up the WiFi Pineapple
 * Monitoring Clients
 * Adding a Landing Page

  
## [Activity 2 - Experimenting Network attacks using Shark Jack and Packet Squirrel(40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Simulating%20network%20attacks%20using%20Shark%20Jack%20and%20Packet%20Squirrel)
* Shark Jack Setup
* Shark Jack Attack
* Packet Squirrel Setup
* Exploring the Packet Sniffer, DNS Spoof, and VPN Tunnel Modes
* Custom Payloads


## [Activity 3 - Packet Sniffing (40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Packet%20Sniffing)
* Packet sniffing
* Running Wireshark
* HTTP Authentication


## [Activity 4 - Network Firewall and Malicious software (Time: 40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Firewalls)
* About Firewalls
* Malicious software
* Network Firewall Virtualisation Exercise

Implementing network firewalls can be a difficult concept for students to grasp initially. These exercises allow students to play with the Network Firewall Visualization tool to expose students to network security and firewall configuration. This tool is intended to teach and reinforce key concepts, including the use and purpose of a perimeter firewall, separated subnets, the purposes behind packet filtering, and the shortcomings of a simple packet filter firewall.
