Dr Aminu Usman
## Plan for today :

## Learning Objectives
To understand the principles and importance of cyber hygiene.

## Overview of the session 

* This session will train and engage students to think proactively about cybersecurity, cyber threats, cybercrimes and improving their understanding of online security. 
   - students would be involved in the discussion on social engineering, the right tools and methods for cyber hygiene
   - general methods and practices of keeping safe and secure online, creating and managing strong password
   - when and how to access public WIFI, and 
   - methods of detecting and reporting cyber harassment. 
   

* Students will perform some exercises using specialised equipment for various cyber hygiene activities, including understanding keystroke injection attacks to execute payloads into network systems, attacking and monitoring keyboard inputs to observe user keystrokes, and setting up listening to transmissions sent over a radio signal. 

## Requirements 

Students would be required to access a computer system, internet connectivity, and access privilege to download and install applications during the session.

## [Activity 1 - Creating a Rogue Wi-Fi Access Point (30 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Creating%20a%20Rogue%20Wi-Fi%20Access%20Point)
 

  
## [Activity 2 - Simulating network attacks using Shark Jack and Packet Squirrel(40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Simulating%20network%20attacks%20using%20Shark%20Jack%20and%20Packet%20Squirrel)
 * Rubber Ducky Parts
* Writing your duckyScript
* Exercises
  - Reconnaissance Scripts
  - Exploit Scripts - Malicious code injection attack


## [Activity 3 - Packet Sniffing (40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Packet%20Sniffing)



## [Activity 4 - Firewalls (Time: 40 Minutes)](https://github.com/CS-Outreach-Session/Network-Security-/tree/main/Firewalls)

Implementing network firewalls can be a difficult concept for students to grasp initially. These exercises allow students to play with the Network Firewall Visualization tool to expose students to network security and firewall configuration. This tool is intended to teach and reinforce key concepts, including the use and purpose of a perimeter firewall, separated subnets, the purposes behind packet filtering, and the shortcomings of a simple packet filter firewall.
